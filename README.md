This is the raw output of ILSpy of an unpacked redline malware sample I found on a scam youtube video.

The file was packed with two stages, it downloads an obfuscated executable from an image hosted on a discord channel,
then this obfuscated executable unpacks the actual malware  ending in a final executable containing the original redline sample.
